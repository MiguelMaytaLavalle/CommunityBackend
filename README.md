# CommunityBackend
This project was a in collaboration with @abbemannen

Part of a fullstack project in which we had to develope a social media webpage for users to register and send messages to others. Users can post to their own or others users board. A user can create a graph and display it on their own board for others to see. Users can initiate a whiteboard in which other users can join and draw on in real-time.

Main technologies that we wanted to explore were DevOps (Docker, Jenkins and Kubernetes and security using JSON Web Tokens.
